# flask_checkerboard

checkerboard2.html is an alternative way of solving. the required /css styling is commented out in green, and will require small manipulations to make work.

checkerboard.html solves all of the challenges within a bit of css to hide gaps and turn an '18x'18 table to '9x'9 (user inputs 9x9, but html creates 18x18 as written).
